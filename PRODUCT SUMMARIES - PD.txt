It contains 16% Nitrogen, 5% Iron, and 2% Sulphur. The addition of Fulvic acid enhances nutrient uptake, delivering fast results and prolonging nutrient availability.Iron is essential for chlorophyll production, which gives plants their green color. Iron deficiency, often caused by high pH, poor aeration, or excess calcium, leads to yellowing or pale leaves with green veins (a condition called iron chlorosis). MaxGreen helps correct this, but persistent issues may require soil pH adjustments.Application Notes:* Lightly water in after use.* Avoid applying in hot weather and near water sources (ponds, pools).* Product may stain surfaces (concrete, clothes, skin).* Not compatible with many other products; perform a jar test before mixing.Safety:* Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and inhalation.* Keep away from children and store in a cool, sealed place.Stimulizer is a highly concentrated bio-stimulant and natural chelating agent made from Fulvic acid, minerals, and natural plant stimulants.

While still safe to use, efficacy may be compromised.Application Rates:* Soil Ameliorant or Fertigation: 10–50 L/ha, with higher rates for soil amelioration.* Home Garden: Dilute 45 mL in 9 L of water, applying 1 L/m? every 2–4 weeks.* Foliar Spray:o Vegetables: 1 L per 100 L water, up to 5 L/ha, weekly.o Orchards & Vineyards: 1 L per 100 L water, up to 7 L/ha, every 2–4 weeks.o Ornamentals & Turf: 1 L per 100 L water, up to 5 L/ha, every 2–4 weeks.o Broadacre Crops: 1–3 L/ha in 60–100 L water, as needed.o Pasture: 1–3 L/ha in 60–100 L water, as needed.o Spot-Spraying: 50 mL per 10 L water, as needed.* Liquid Inject: 2–5 L/ha, with a minimum dilution of 1:3 product to water.Typical Analysis:* Calcium (Ca): 16.5%* Sulfur (S): 13.0%* Specific Gravity (SG): 1.42* pH: 6.9* Appearance: Thick, off-white/cream liquidInstructions for Use:* Shake or stir well before use; maintain constant agitation during application.* Pre-mix slowly to prevent settling of solids; a coarse inline filter (500 microns) is recommended.* Avoid spraying close to harvest to prevent staining on sensitive crops.* Store in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight; the product can be stored down to 5ºC, but sedimentation may occur below this temperature.Handling Precautions:Due to its heavy nature, take care to avoid back injuries when handling.Iron (Ferrous) Sulphate Heptahydrate PowderOverview:Iron (Ferrous) Sulphate Heptahydrate is a slow-release powder primarily used to correct iron chlorosis, eliminate moss, reduce soil alkalinity, and provide essential trace elements in fertilisers. Although not as rapid-acting as iron chelate, it offers longer-lasting effects and can be mixed with compost for long-term soil improvement.Key Benefits:* Corrects iron deficiencies in plants and soils.* Eliminates moss and acts as a turf hardener against diseases.* Reduces soil pH, making iron more available for plant uptake.* Encourages deep greening of turf without excessive growth, minimizing nitrogen fertiliser use.* Environmentally friendly alternative to high-nitrogen fertilisers.Soil Test Recommendation:Conduct a soil test to assess pH, organic matter, and nutrient levels before applying amendments. This helps identify iron deficiencies, indicated by yellowing leaves (chlorosis), particularly in alkaline soils.Soil Acidification:Contains over 19.5% iron and 11.5% oxidised sulfur. When applied, soil microbes break down these components, releasing sulfur and iron for plant use. The process also lowers soil pH, beneficial for alkaline soils. However, excessive application can lead to overly acidic conditions.Application Rates:1. To Correct Iron Deficiency:o Rate: 20–30 g/m?o Method: Spread evenly or mix with water and spray. Water in well. Reapply every season as needed.2. For Soil Acidity:o Rate: 25–35 g/m?o Method: Spread evenly or mix with water and spray. Water in well. Reapply as needed.3. To Eliminate Moss:o Rate: 10–20 g/m?o Method: Spread evenly or mix with water and spray. Water in well. Apply as needed, preferably in spring or every 6–8 weeks during the winter.Application Tips:* For best results, treat the entire lawn to avoid uneven pH levels.* Avoid walking on treated areas until thoroughly watered.* Use a broadcast spreader for even application, and wear protective gloves and a dust mask when handling.Warnings:* Can stain paths, concrete, and clothing; exercise caution during application.* Keep pets off treated areas for at least one week, and horses for four weeks; avoid grazing on treated areas.Typical Analysis:* Iron (Fe): >19.5%* Sulfur (S): 11.5%NATURE’S SOIL WETTER - Dry GranulesOverview:NATURE’S SOIL WETTER is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly soil conditioner designed to enhance water distribution and retention in various soil types.
